# Union-Find-Flight-Alternatives
### This project return a list of flights (in the same format as they were given) that could be replaced by a rail journey.
#### A flight can be replaced by a rail journey if, on the day of the flight, there is any series of high-speed rail lines connecting the departure city to the arrival city, no matter how circuitous the root may be.
